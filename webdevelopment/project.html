<p><strong>Competency:</strong> Apply the core principles, ethics, values, and body of knowledge to questions in library and information science, according to their area of specialty.</p><p>
<strong>Relevant Coursework:</strong> Community Analysis assignment -<br>ISLT 7313: Collection Access and Management (Fall 2023)</p><p>
<strong>Description:</strong> In this assignment, students were asked to choose a library, research its respective community using demographic data, news coverage, and interviews, and write a community analysis in a narrative style. A successful community analysis needed to describe the community, analyze the needs of different community members, and identify how community needs might inform collection access and management policies. Areas of impact to explore included library collection development, access policies, and outreach services. Students were evaluated on their ability to follow instructions, use data to inform a narrative, and analyze the needs of all members of the community, with an emphasis on diverse populations.</p><p>
<strong>Artifact:</strong> <a href="../webcontent/ElanCommunityAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank">Community Analysis (PDF)</a></p><p>
<strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment gave me the opportunity to practice analyzing multiple sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative, local and federal) for the purposes of library decision-making. It also showed me what types of questions to address in a community analysis. I completed this assignment largely using census data. If I were to redo it, I would also consult news sources and interviews to obtain a more well-rounded view of my community. </p></div>

<div><h3 id="project2">Project 2</h3>
<p><strong>Competency:</strong> Demonstrate evaluative and analytical skills needed to respond flexibly and adaptably to future changes and challenges within the organizations and institutions where they will be employed.</p><p>
<strong>Relevant Coursework:</strong> Budget Presentation assignment from ISLT 9410: Welcome to Budgeting for Libraries (Summer 2023)</p><p>
<strong>Description:</strong> In this assignment, students were tasked with evaluating budget figures for a fictional library, preparing a fifteen-minute budget proposal presentation for the Library Board of Trustees, and delivering the presentation. Students were provided with an Excel workbook containing budget figures, specifically, actual figures for the past two years, budget figures for the current year (actual figures leading to the current date and expected figures between the current date and end of year), and a proposed budget for the following year. Presentations were recorded using VoiceThread. Students were evaluated on clarity of presentation delivery and inclusion of key components, such as the library’s mission statement, previous year highlights, goals for the upcoming year, alignment between goals and proposed budget, explanations for revenue expectations, and meaningful charts and graphs.</p><p>
<strong>Artifacts:</strong> <a href="../webcontent/ElanBudgetPresentation.pdf" target="_blank">Budget Presentation (PDF)</a>, <a href="../webcontent/ElanBudgetInformation.pdf" target="_blank">Budget Information (PDF)</a></p><p>
<strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment was practical and applicable. I have seen my own library director present budgets to City Council and the Library Board. One of the strengths of the assignment lies in its ambiguity. As with real budgets, the figures can be interpreted several ways; there is not one correct interpretation. Another strength of the assignment was the inclusion of realistic elements. It was assumed that the Board would have a copy of the budget for reference and a working understanding of common library terms. Through this assignment, I practiced extrapolating from data and acting decisively.</p></div>

<h3 id="project3">Project 3</h3>
<p><strong>Competency:</strong> Assess community needs, formulate plans to respond to users of information agencies, and instruct users in using informational resources.</p><p>
<strong>Relevant Coursework:</strong> Collection Evaluation assignment from ISLT 7313: Collection Access and Management (Fall 2023)</p><p>
<strong>Description:</strong> In this assignment, students were asked to demonstrate their understanding of collection evaluation techniques and methods by creating a plan for evaluating a print or digital collection of their choice. Collection evaluation plans needed to include discussion of the collection chosen for analysis, identification of the goals of the collection analysis, description of selected evaluation methods and methods that were considered but not utilized, as well as how results could impact management of the collection in the future. Other important considerations included whether the evaluation plan was practical and reasonable and if the goals of the collection analysis were meaningful.</p><p>
<strong>Artifact:</strong> <a href="../webcontent/ElanCollectionEvaluation.pdf" target="_blank">Collection Evaluation PDF</a></p><p>
<strong>Reflection:</strong> The strengths of this assignment include its relevance to library work and how it allowed me to practice using my newfound learning about collection evaluation. I especially appreciated the opportunity to propose a collection evaluation plan and receive critical feedback from someone knowledgeable in the subject. In this project, I planned to evaluate my library’s book on CD collections. Since then, I have learned about alternative formats and would discuss those if I had the opportunity to redo the project.
