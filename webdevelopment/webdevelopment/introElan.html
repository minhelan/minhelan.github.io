     <p>Hello! My name is Minh Elan (Min El-Lahn). I am the Adult Services Manager at Neill Public Library in Pullman, Washington.</p><p>I have experience customizing webpages using web content managers, WYSIWYG editors, HTML, and CSS. My experience with HTML and CSS coding is fairly basic and specific to the needs of my library’s webpages. In this course, I hope to develop a deeper understanding of how webpages function and familiarity with web terminology. I will use this knowledge to improve my library’s webpages by writing more sophisticated code and by making more informed requests of our web vendor.</p><p>In my free time, I like to sit in the sun with my two dogs, read, and play cozy video games. I am lackadaisically learning to knit.</p>
