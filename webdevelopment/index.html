    <h2>Minh Elan, Library and Information Science</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my library science portfolio! My name is Minh Elan. CVs, resumes, and educational certificates can only go so far - this website serves as a showcase of my achievements as a Library and Information Science student and a space for reflection on my educational journey. Included on these pages are examples of my academic work, lessons learned in hindsight, and a little information about myself. The selected assignments demonstrate my mastery of the University of Missouri’s Master of Library and Information Science program student learning outcomes.</p>
