     Hello World! My name is Minh Elan (Min El-Lahn). I am the Adult Services Manager at Neill Public Library in Pullman, Washington. <p>I have experience customizing webpages using web content managers, WYSIWYG editors, HTML, and CSS. I learned specific aspects of HTML and CSS coding to customize my library’s webpages. In this course, I hope to develop a deeper understanding of how webpages function and familiarity with web terminology.</p><p> I will use this knowledge to improve my library’s webpages by writing more sophisticated code and by making more informed requests of our web vendor. In my free time, I like to sit in the sun with my two dogs, read, and play cozy video games.</p>
