            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
            <strong>Hello!</strong> I am Minh Elan, Adult Services Manager at Neill Public Library. NPL serves residents of Pullman, Washington, and I lead our adult services team. Classes and crafts, conversations and books – these are all part of the work. I come by the desire to help adults honestly. As a first-generation Vietnamese American, I watched my immigrant father build a life for his entire 13-person family from the ground up, with help from my rudimentary <em>(but free)</em> translation services.<br><br>
            I first earned a master’s degree in psychology, thinking I could improve lives one counseling session at a time. It turns out I am too impatient for step-by-step plans and found a better fit in the fast pace and wide reach of public libraries. Today, I am in the University of Missouri Library and Information Science program. I hope to continue leveraging my experience and skills for the good of my community.</p>
