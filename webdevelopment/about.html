        <h3>About Me</h3>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Hello!</strong> I am Minh Elan, Adult Services Manager at Neill Public Library. NPL serves the City of Pullman, Washington, and I lead our adult services team. Classes and crafts, conversations and books – these are all part of the work I love. I come by the desire to help adults honestly. As a first-generation Vietnamese American, I watched my immigrant father build a life for his entire 13-person family from the ground up, with help from my rudimentary= <em>(but always free!)</em> translation services. <br><br>
In 2015, I earned a master’s degree in psychology, thinking I could improve lives one counseling session at a time. It turns out I am too impatient for the average step-by-step plan. I found a better fit in the fast pace and wide reach of public libraries. Today, I am a student in the University of Missouri Master of Library and Information Science program. I expect to graduate in December 2025. <br><br>
My coursework focuses on public library and administration work. I have worked in public libraries since 2017 and hope to continue leveraging my experience and skills for the good of my community. </p>
