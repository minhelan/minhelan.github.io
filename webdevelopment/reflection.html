        <h3>Master of Library and Information Science Program</3>
<div>
    <p class="intro">Prior to enrolling in the University of Missouri’s Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program in January 2023, I had been working full-time at Neill Public Library in Pullman, Washington since 2017. My experiences in library administration, circulation, reference, and adult services led me to hold biases about which library courses would be valuable or difficult. I expected Reader’s Advisory and Emerging Technologies in Libraries to be easy or superfluous, but I quickly discovered new dimensions of librarianship. For example, I was surprised by the sheer variety of Reader’s Advisory tools and the necessity of library technology plans. </p>  
    <p class="reflectionp">My coursework has been diverse and engaging. I especially appreciate learning from library professionals beyond my local sphere. As the current Adult Services Manager at Neill Public Library, I strive to be a librarian who inspires confidence, engages proactively, and responds thoughtfully. The MLIS program strengthens my ability to do just that. I am building competencies in emerging library trends, library principles and history, and analytical and management skills suiting a variety of library needs, especially as they relate to user-focused services. These will be vital as I navigate complex library issues like rising e-material costs, censorship, and legislative scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="reflectionp">In addition to academic growth, the program has challenged me to practice important life skills. As a working professional, balancing graduate coursework, full-time work, and personal obligations has been a challenge. During previous academic experiences, I had the privilege of devoting myself to school full-time. In contrast, the MLIS program has required careful time management and prioritization. At times, I had to choose between doing well in work, school, and personal life or excelling in one area and seeking support in another. I am grateful to the University of Missouri faculty for structuring their courses with understanding and flexibility.</p>
    <p class="reflectionp">With the knowledge I have gained at the University of Missouri, I hope to bring to Neill Public Library programs that suit Pullman’s unique demographic. Over the years, I have noticed that many people of color, college students, and young professionals in Pullman are not library users, despite census results showing that more than half of those in Pullman are 20 to 39 years old, and 12% of Pullman residents identify as Asian, 8% as Hispanic/Latino, and 9% as another race or multiracial. The library’s user demographic skews toward children and their parents, older adults, and white- or Asian-appearing residents. The MLIS program has prepared me to plan and implement thoughtful programming and collections that better serve these underserved groups. I am especially eager to conduct community analyses to address this challenge.</p>
